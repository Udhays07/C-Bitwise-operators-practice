# C-Bitwise-operators-practice
For the practice of C bitwise operators, I have solved problems and added the same in this repository.
1. Write a C program to check Least Significant Bit (LSB) of a number is set or not.[(code)](https://github.com/Udhays07/C-Bitwise-operators-practice/blob/main/LSB.c)
2. Write a C program to check Most Significant Bit (MSB) of a number is set or not.[(code)](https://github.com/Udhays07/C-Bitwise-operators-practice/blob/main/MSB.c)
3. Write a C program to get nth bit of a number.
4. Write a C program to set nth bit of a number.
5. Write a C program to clear nth bit of a number.
6. Write a C program to toggle nth bit of a number.
7. Write a C program to get highest set bit of a number.
8. Write a C program to get lowest set bit of a number.
9. Write a C program to count trailing zeros in a binary number.
10. Write a C program to count leading zeros in a binary number.
11. Write a C program to flip bits of a binary number using bitwise operator.
12. Write a C program to count total zeros and ones in a binary number.
